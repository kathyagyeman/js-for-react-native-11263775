Explanation of each task

Task 1:
In this task, i created a JavaScript file named 'arrayManipulation.js' and wrote a function 'processArray'. This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

Task 2:
In the same file ('arrayManipulation.js), i added another function 'formatArrayStrings'. 
This function takes two arrays as arguments : an array of strings, and an array of numbers processed by 'processArray'.
It modifies each each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing th entire string if its number is even, and converting the string to lower case if the number is odd.

Task 3:
I created another JavaScipt file named 'userInfo.js'.
In this file, i wrote a function 'createUserProfiles'. 
This function takes array of names and an array of modified names that were used in task 2.
It then returns an array of objects,each containing 'originalName', 'modifiedName', and 'id' (which auto-increments from 1).
